## Introduction

> ðŸ”” This project does not work with released wazo-platform versions. Patches are needed to make it works.

This project have been built during the Wazo Hackathon 2022.

The main objective of the team was to explore :
- Implement group chat features, markdown support and reactions.
- Create a bridge between Wazo Stack and [Matrix Framework](https://github.com/matrix-org)

Here are some screenshots of the app we created.

| Markdown Support | Room Creation | Emojis & Reactions |
